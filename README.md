# My Journey into Data Science 
Here are my projects I have done or currently working on mainly for school.
They showcase the skills I have learned using R and Python throughout my tenure at Emory University.

Here's the rundown of each of the projects:

'JerryAkshayUziel' is my group final project working with NBA statistics showcasing different visualizations demonstrating the effect of increased usage of the 3-point shot. We use RMarkdown to code and summarize our findings. 

'GitikaJerryCashin' is my group final project that extends what we learn in the previous group project. The main techniques feature data cleaning methods as well as creating an interactive Plotly visualization. We utilize a different data set of NBA statistics in recent seasons. 

'Final_ProjectJerryCalvinJaimes' is my group final project takes a look at income statistics grouped by regions of the United States. We use Python and Jupyter Notebook to code and summarize our findings. 

My final project is to create a basic library checkout system using Java. It features a basic login system as well as a GUI interface.

I include my assignments I have done in my ECON 220 class where we learn various data cleaning, visualizing, and probability testing using Python

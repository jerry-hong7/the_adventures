# My Journey into Data Science 
Here are my projects I have done or currently working on mainly for school.
They showcase the skills I have learned using R and Python throughout my tenure at Emory University.

Here's the rundown of each of the projects:

'QTM 150' is my group final project working with NBA statistics showcasing different visualizations demonstrating the effect of increased usage of the 3-point shot. We use RMarkdown to code and summarize our findings. 

'QTM 151' is my group final project that extends what we learn in the previous group project. The main techniques feature data cleaning methods as well as creating an interactive Plotly visualization. We utilize a different data set of NBA statistics in recent seasons. 

'Final_ProjectECON220' is my group final project takes a look at income statistics grouped by regions of the United States. We use Python and Jupyter Notebook to code and summarize our findings. I include my assignments I have done in my ECON 220 class where we learn various data cleaning, visualizing, and probability testing using Python and compile them in JupyterLab notebooks.

My final project in my computer science class is to create a basic library checkout system using Java. It features a basic login system as well as a GUI interface.

ECON 320 is Econometrics where we learn how to implement and interpret regression models and be able to effectively create accurate prediction models minimized by biases and multicollinearity.

QTM 250 is an introductory class to cloud computing where we learn Python for data modeling as well as the basics of Google Cloud and the services it provides. One of the assignments feature a demo of GCP's APIs where we demoed the Vision API to see how well it can detect emotion through a series of pictures of our group members.

QTM 350 is a step up from 250 where we learn the services within AWS. In our final project, RapidStudy, I helped integrate the Textract API from AWS and feed files from an S3 bucket to extract text from the API. From there, I feed this into the ChatGPT API for it to generate a condensed study guide from the class notes uploaded to the S3 bucket.

    "The range of the math4 values is 0 to 100. My initial thought is that this range is plausible because you can have either all or none of the students be satisfactory. There are 38 schools that have a perfect pass rate in 4th grade math, which makes up roughly 2% of the total sample size. There are 17 schools that have a pass rate of 50%. The average pass rates for math and reading are about 72% and 60% respectively, suggesting that the reading test is harder to pass. The correlation between math4 and read4 is 0.84. This suggests there is a relatively strong positive relationship between the two tests, indicating students who pass the math test are also likely to pass the reading test. From the table, the average expenditure per pupil (exppp) is 5194.87 with a standard deviation of 1091.89. This value to me suggests there is quite a wide variation in per pupil spending, especially considering the range between the min and max. \n",

## Introducing our Data Set

This data set includes statistics of every NBA player from each team from the 1977-2020 (courtesy of FiveThirtyEight). Additionally, we included FiveThirtyEight's glossary to better understand what each category represents. You may notice that the five major stats are per 36 minutes instead of per game. One possible reason FiveThirtyEight measures this is to evaluate the player's performance on a per-minute basis. Plus, most starters average roughly 36-37 minutes per game, so rounding it to 36 minutes gives a decent representation of the player's production on the court. 

```{r load_set}
nba_set <-  read_csv("./nba-data-historical.csv")
nba_set
```

```{r categories, out.width = "75%"}
    knitr::include_graphics("./Categories.png")
```

```{r structure}
str(nba_set)
```
According to this structure, there are 20,059 rows and 40 columns. Each row represents a player of that particular team's season. Each column represents one of the 40 variables in this data set. 


```{r summary}
summary(nba_set)
```

In this summary, there are a mix of basic and advanced statistics for each player. We found some statistics  interesting to point out. One is that the defensive rating (DRtg) is relatively consistent across the 1st quarter through 3rd quarters. Another statistic to point is out that the mean for three-point field goal percentage (3P%) while accounting for 4342 missing values is 25.52%. It doesn't seem comparable to the NBA nowadays as we see more prolific three-point shooters.

## Determining which NBA Position on Average Scores the Most Points per Decade

Our first research question is to find out which position scores the most points on average from the decades 1980-2020. We did this by subsetting the data set where we only consider the five main positions (Point Guard (PG), Shooting Guard(SG), Small Forward(SF), Power Forward (PF), and Center(C)). This is to only consider the players who purely play on one of these positions as some have played multiple positions. 

```{r Q.1 Positions}
#Akshay 
nba_set %>%
  select(year_id, pos, `P/36`) %>%
  subset(pos %in% c("PG", "SG", "SF", "PF", "C")) %>%
  mutate(decade = floor(year_id/10) * 10) %>%
  group_by(decade, pos) %>%
  summarise(avg_pos_pts = mean(`P/36`, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(decade, avg_pos_pts)) + 
  
  geom_bar(aes(fill = pos), position = "dodge", stat = "identity") + 
  labs(title = "Evolution of NBA Scoring By Position By Decade", x = "Decade", y = "Average Points") +
    xlim(1975, 2015) +
    ylim(0,20) + 
    theme_clean() +
    theme(legend.title = element_blank()) + 
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel1")
    
    
  
 
```

Based on this graph, we can see that there were no instances of drastic change throughout the course of this time period. The scoring average for all positions were always between the range of about 12.5 to 16 points. One trend that can be noticed is that shooting guards and small forwards scored less points on average as each decade passed by, while point guards scored more points. Another trend that is shown is that the power forward position seemed to be the most consistent throughout the four decades, as the scoring average for this position was around 14 points for all four decades. Furthermore, the 2010s is the decade in with the smallest scoring gaps among the five positions, in comparison to the other three decades.

To answer the question, there was not much evolution in regards to the scoring averages of each of the five positions. Although the scoring average for shooting guards slightly decreased in every decade, this position held the highest scoring average for every decade (with the exception of the 1990s, where it was edged out slightly by small forwards). On the other hand, centers usually scored the least amounts of points during each decade.

## Evolution of the Three-Point Shot

Our second question for this data set is how has the three-point shooting evolved over time. There are two ways we can go about answering this. One is to group the teams by division (Atlantic, Central, Southeast, Northwest, Pacific, and Southwest). Then, we can measure the average rate of three-point of attempts for each division. We can facet the plot to see how the three point usage has evolved for each division. 


```{r Q.2 Divisions}
#Jerry
nba_set %>% 
  mutate(Division = case_when(franch_id %in% c("MIL", "IND", "CHI", "CLE", "DET") ~ "CENTRAL",
                              franch_id %in% c("MIA", "ORL", "CHA", "WAS", "ATL") ~ "SOUTHEAST", 
                              franch_id %in% c("DEN", "OKC", "UTA", "POR", "MIN") ~ "NORTHWEST",
                              franch_id %in% c("LAL", "LAC", "GSW", "SAC", "PHO") ~ "PACIFIC",
                              franch_id %in% c("HOU", "DAL", "SAS", "MEM", "NOH") ~ "SOUTHWEST",
                              franch_id %in% c("NYK", "TOR", "BOS", "NJN", "PHI") ~ "ATLANTIC")) %>%
  
  group_by(Division, year_id) %>%
  summarize(avg_3Usage = mean(`3PAr`, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = year_id, y = avg_3Usage, color = Division)) + 
  labs(title = "Average Three-Point Usage by NBA Division", 
       x = "Year",
       y = "Three-Point Usage (Percentage)") + 
  facet_wrap(~ Division) + 
  theme_clean() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") 

```

The graph above depicts the average three point usage for each of the six NBA divisions from 1977-2020. It is clear that for all divisions, there is a steep increase in three-point attempts since the introduction of the three-point line in 1979. We see a sizable increased rate in three-point attempts from 20% to up to 40% at around early to mid-2010's. This makes sense as the floor is more spaced and we have players like Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and James Harden, who have been some of the contributors of utilizing the three-point shot more often.

One thing to point out is that all divisions experienced dips in three point usage in the late 1990s to early 2000s. This is probably due to the more stifling defenses along the perimeter, which will discourage teams from attempting three-pointers. Additionally, centers and forwards were the focal point of offenses, whereas guards run the offense and feeding the ball to their centers and forwards. Since then, all divisions experienced increases in three-point usage, but the Central, Northwest, and Southeast divisions experienced much steeper increases in the mid 2010s, which was when three-point shooting really became mainstream.


Our second method is to create a heat map that shows the three-point usage for every franchise. Note that some franchises were founded later than others, which is why there are gaps within the heat map. 

```{r Q.2 Heatmap} 
#Uziel
nba_set %>%
  group_by(franch_id, year_id) %>%
summarise(`%Attempts` = mean(`3PAr`, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year_id, franch_id)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = `%Attempts`)) +
  labs(title = "Evolution of the 3 Point Shot by Franchise per Year",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Franchise",
       fill = "Attempt Percentage") + 
  theme_clean()
```
Figure Interpretation: From this figure, we can see that 3 point field goal attempts have increased drastically since the NBA introduced the three-point line. Notable franchises that rely heavily on these attempts today include HOU, MIN, and TOR.

#### So, how has 3 point usage evolved over time?

In the beginning, the 3 point shot was virtually nonexistent with a field goal attempt percentage in the low single digits. Over time however, teams and coaches began to realize the efficiency of the shot and, as visualized in both graphs, 3 point shots increased significantly as a result across the board. Today, 3 point shots are a major part of basketball with some teams having nearly as much as 50% of their shots being 3 point attempts.
